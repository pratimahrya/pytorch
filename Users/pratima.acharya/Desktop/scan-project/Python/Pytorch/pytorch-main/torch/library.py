    r"""Register an abstract implementation for this operator.

    An "abstract implementation" specifies the behavior of this operator on
    Tensors that carry no data. Given some input Tensors with certain properties
    (sizes/strides/storage_offset/device), it specifies what the properties of
    the output Tensors are.

    The abstract implementation has the same signature as the operator.
    It is run for both FakeTensors and meta tensors. To write an abstract
    implementation, assume that all Tensor inputs to the operator are
    regular CPU/CUDA/Meta tensors, but they do not have storage, and
    you are trying to return regular CPU/CUDA/Meta tensor(s) as output.
    The abstract implementation must consist of only PyTorch operations
    (and may not directly access the storage or data of any input or
    intermediate Tensors).

    This API may be used as a decorator (see examples).
